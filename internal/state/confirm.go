// ConfirmByRepeat implements the "run it again to permit" override against the
// store at stateFile on fs. On the first denial of command it arms a pending
// entry (confirmable only in the band [now+delay, now+window]) and returns the
// denial with an added, deliberately stern hint. A later identical re-run is
// allowed only once the delay has elapsed and before the window closes; an
// over-eager repeat inside the delay is refused with a sharper rebuke and does
// NOT reset the timer. The bool reports whether this call consumed a confirmation.
//
// Callers must only invoke this for a *confirmable* denial; an inviolate rule is
// gated out upstream (engine.Response.Confirmable), so repeating it never reaches
// here. now is injected so callers (and tests) control the clock. This is an
// escape hatch, not a security control — the delay raises the cost of a reflexive
// bypass, it does not prevent a determined one.
