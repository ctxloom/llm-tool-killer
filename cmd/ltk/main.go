		Long: `ltk is a pre-tool hook for LLM coding agents. It gates two kinds of action:

  • shell commands (Bash/PowerShell tools) — matched by command rules, which
    parse the command and match program/args across shells.
  • file edits (Edit/Write/MultiEdit/NotebookEdit tools) — matched by file
    rules (match.path), which match the target file path against globs.

File (match.path) rules use full globs (*, ?, [..], {a,b}, and ** which spans
directories). A trailing slash means a whole directory subtree (vendor/ blocks
everything under vendor). The special pattern "@submodules" expands to every
path in .gitmodules, so one rule blocks edits inside all git submodules.

On a denial the agent is handed your message and suggested alternative so it can
retry the right way. See docs/RULES.md for the full rule model.`,
