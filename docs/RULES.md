# Rule reference

Rules live in a YAML file (see [`examples/rules.yaml`](../examples/rules.yaml)).
Every command an agent proposes is parsed into a command graph; **each** command
in that graph is tested against the rules **in order**, and the **first matching
`deny` rule wins**. Its `message` and `suggest` are returned to the model so it
can retry the right way.

"Each command in the graph" means a denied command is caught no matter how it is
wrapped — inside pipelines, `&&`/`||`/`;` sequences, subshells `( … )`, brace
groups, command substitution `$( … )` / backticks, process substitution
`<( … )`, assignments (`x=$(…)`), backgrounding (`&`), and `if`/`for`/`while`
bodies. Quoted text is *not* a command, so `echo "go test"` does not match a
`go test` rule. (See the nesting tests in `internal/app`.)

```yaml
version: 1

defaults:
  shell: bash               # fallback dialect (see Shell resolution in ARCHITECTURE.md)
  on_parse_error: allow     # command couldn't be parsed at all → allow (fail-open) | deny
  repeat_window_seconds: 30 # window for `mode: confirm` rules (see Rule mode)

rules:
  - id: go-test-to-just            # required, unique
    match: { command: [go, test] } # see "Matching commands" below
    action: deny                   # deny (default) | allow
    message: "Use `just test`."    # shown to the model on deny
    suggest: "just test"           # optional replacement command
    mode: enable                   # enable (default) | confirm | disable (see Rule mode)
```

Unknown YAML keys are rejected, so a typo (`programm:`) is an error, not a
silent no-op.

## Matching commands

The `match.command` pattern is the program plus its arguments. It can be written
as a string (split on whitespace) or a list (verbatim):

```yaml
match: { command: "go test" }     # ≡
match: { command: [go, test] }
```

Tokens are classified into two kinds. **This is the core of the model:**

| Kind | What it is | How it matches |
|---|---|---|
| **Program** | the first token | `argv[0]` exactly **or by basename** (so `/usr/local/go/bin/go` matches `go`) |
| **Positional** (operand) | a non-option token (subcommand: `test`, `commit`) | **order matters** — must be an ordered prefix of the command's non-option arguments |
| **Option** (flag) | any flag (`-c`, `-x`, `--no-cache`) | **order does not matter** — must appear somewhere in the arguments; never consumes a positional slot |

(These are the standard CLI terms: a positional is a POSIX *operand*; an option
is the flag kind, what `argparse`/`clap` print under "options".)

Trailing arguments are always allowed. A pattern array may **freely mix**
positionals and options in any list order — tokens are classified by kind, not
by where they sit in the list, so `[docker, --debug, build]` and
`[docker, build, --debug]` are equivalent.

### Why positional vs option

A subcommand's position is meaningful: `go test` and `go help test` are different
operations, so `test` is matched **positionally** (it must be the first
non-option argument). An option's position is not meaningful: `sh -e -c …` and
`sh -c -e …` are the same, so options are matched as an **unordered set**.
Options are also skipped when locating positionals, so a leading option never
hides a subcommand: `go --mod=mod test` still matches `[go, test]`.

### Examples

```yaml
match: { command: go }                              # any `go …`
match: { command: [go, test] }                      # `go test …`, `go --mod=mod test …`
match: { command: "sh -c" }                         # `sh -c …`, `sh -e -c …`  (NOT `sh -e`)
match: { command: [git, push, --force, --no-verify] } # those flags in ANY order after `push`
```

### Refinements

Optional, program-agnostic conditions refine a `command` match (or stand on
their own). `args_any` and `args_all` are **positive** filters — the listed
tokens must be present:

```yaml
# A docker build that publishes: `docker build` (or `buildx`) carrying both
# --push and --tag.
match:
  command: docker
  args_any: [build, buildx]   # at least one present anywhere in args
  args_all: ["--push", "--tag"]   # all present anywhere in args
```

**`unless`** is the **negative** one: it lists exception tokens, and if the
command contains any of them the rule does **not** match. It reads as English —
"match `git clean` *unless* `--dry-run` is present." This is how you carve out
the read-only / safe form of a command you otherwise block:

```yaml
# Block destructive `git clean`, but allow the preview form.
match:
  command: [git, clean]
  unless: ["-n", "--dry-run"]   # `git clean -n` only previews — fine
```

```yaml
# Block creating tags, but allow read-only listing.
- id: no-git-tag
  match:
    command: [git, tag]
    unless: ["--list", "-l", "-n"]   # `git tag --list` is fine
  message: "Releases go through the pipeline, not a hand-cut `git tag`."
```

Other genuine `unless` cases: `rsync … unless: ["-n", "--dry-run"]`,
`make … unless: ["-n", "--dry-run"]`, `helm upgrade … unless: ["--dry-run"]`.
(Note `--dry-run` is **not** universal — `docker build`/`run`, for instance, have
no dry-run; only `docker compose` does. Use the flag the target command actually
supports.)

All argument conditions see bundled short options expanded (so `-n` in `unless`
matches `rm -rn` too), and they are checked after `command` — an `unless` hit on
a non-matching command is moot.

## Portability across shells

Flag syntax differs by shell, so the option/positional classification is
**shell-aware**. The shell is resolved per command (see ARCHITECTURE.md) and the
same rule works everywhere:

| Shell family | A token is an **option** (flag) when it… |
|---|---|
| sh, bash, zsh, mksh | starts with `-` (`-c`, `--no-cache`). A lone `-` is positional (stdin). |
| PowerShell (pwsh) | starts with `-` (`-Path`, `-Recurse`). |
| cmd.exe | starts with `/` (`/c`, `/s`) **or** `-`. |

The `cmd` distinction matters: under cmd, `/c` is a switch, but under a POSIX
shell `/usr/bin/x` is a path — so the same leading-`/` token is an option in one
and positional in the other.

### Restricting a rule to certain shells (`match.shells`)

By default a rule applies under **every** shell. `match.shells` narrows it to a
list of dialects: the rule is only considered when the command's resolved shell
(see [Shell resolution](ARCHITECTURE.md#shell-resolution)) is one of them. An
absent or empty `shells` means "all shells".

```yaml
match:
  command: [del, /q]      # cmd's delete; `/q` is an option only under cmd
  shells: [cmd]           # so scope the rule to cmd
```

Valid entries are `sh`, `bash`, `zsh`, `mksh`, `pwsh`, and `cmd`; an unknown
shell is a config error (caught at load, like any other typo). The list is an
unordered set — `[cmd, pwsh]` and `[pwsh, cmd]` are identical.

Reach for `shells` when a rule is only meaningful, or only classifies correctly,
on certain dialects:

- **Flag syntax that only parses one way on the target shell** — the leading-`/`
  case above. `[robocopy, /mir], shells: [cmd]` matches `/mir` as an option; on a
  POSIX shell `/mir` would be read as a path operand and the rule wouldn't fire
  as intended.
- **Shell-specific builtins or cmdlets** — e.g. a PowerShell `Invoke-WebRequest`
  rule (`shells: [pwsh]`) that has no bearing on bash.
- **Platform-scoped policy** — a rule you only want to enforce where a given
  shell is in use.

If a rule is shell-agnostic (most are — `git`, `go`, `rm` mean the same thing
everywhere), omit `shells` so it covers them all.

#### How it combines with the rest of the match

`shells` is one condition in the `match` block, and **all** conditions in a
`match` must hold (logical AND). So `shells` acts as a gate evaluated *before*
the command pattern: if the resolved shell isn't in the list, the rule is skipped
outright and `command`/`args_any`/`args_all` are never even tested. A rule with
*only* `shells` and no `command` matches every command under those shells — which
is occasionally what you want (a blanket "this rule set doesn't apply on
Windows-`cmd`" guard), but usually you pair it with a `command`.

#### Which shell is "the resolved shell"

`shells` is checked against the single shell ltk resolved for the whole command
line, not per-token or per-program. That shell comes from the resolution
precedence in [ARCHITECTURE.md](ARCHITECTURE.md#shell-resolution) (force flag →
engine/tool hint → `defaults.shell` → `$SHELL` → `bash`). Two consequences worth
internalizing:

- A wrapped inner command is re-parsed under the *inner* shell. So
  `pwsh -Command "..."` run from bash yields nested commands whose shell is
  `pwsh`; a `shells: [pwsh]` rule will match them even though the outer line was
  bash. You scope to where the command actually runs, not where it was typed.
- If resolution lands on the wrong dialect (e.g. nothing hinted the shell and it
  fell back to `bash` on a Windows box), a `shells: [cmd]` rule won't fire. When
  a rule mysteriously doesn't match, check the resolved shell first.

#### Worked example

```yaml
rules:
  - id: no-cmd-rmdir
    match:
      command: [rmdir, /s]    # cmd's recursive dir delete; /s is its switch
      shells: [cmd]
    message: "Don't recursively delete directories from the agent."
```

| Command line | Resolved shell | Fires? | Why |
|---|---|---|---|
| `rmdir /s build` | cmd | ✅ | shell in list; `/s` classifies as an option under cmd |
| `rmdir /s build` | bash | ❌ | shell not in `[cmd]` — rule skipped before matching |
| `rmdir /something` | cmd | ❌ | shell matches, but `/something` ≠ the `/s` option |

The second row is the whole point: the *same text* is correct to block under cmd
and meaningless (a path operand) under a POSIX shell, so the rule is deliberately
scoped to where it parses correctly.

#### Multi-shell rules

List more than one dialect when a rule applies to a family but not all:

```yaml
match:
  command: [curl]
  shells: [bash, zsh, sh, mksh]   # POSIX shells only; skip pwsh/cmd
```

There is no wildcard and no "all-POSIX" shorthand — list the dialects
explicitly. Omitting `shells` entirely is the only "every shell" form.

**Bundled short options.** Under a POSIX shell, a single-dash cluster like `-rf`
is matched as if it also carried `-r` and `-f` separately (the getopt
convention), so `match: { command: rm, args_all: [-r, -f] }` catches `rm -rf`,
`rm -fr`, and `rm -r -f` alike. This is a matcher-only heuristic — the command
itself is never rewritten. Only POSIX shells expand this way: cmd (`/switch`)
and PowerShell (`-LongName`) don't bundle, so their tokens are never split.
(Why this lives in ltk and not the shell parser: bundling is a per-program
getopt convention — Go's `flag`, `find`, and `dd` don't follow it — so a shell
parser can't know to split it.)

## Understanding (catching trivial workarounds)

We don't block on "scary" constructs — we **understand** them. Before matching,
a command is resolved as far as is statically possible, so an LLM can't sneak a
denied command past a rule with a trivial wrapper or a variable:

- **Variable resolution (shell).** Variable dereferences are expanded against the
  process environment (the hook inherits the callee's env) plus assignments seen
  earlier in the same command. So `t=test; go $t` and `CMD="go test"; bash -c
  "$CMD"` match the `go test` rule. Values we can't know (command output, `$1`)
  expand to empty and are simply not matched.
- **Wrapper re-parsing.** The inner command of a trivial wrapper —
  `bash -c "…"`, `sh -c "…"`, `eval "…"`, `cmd /c "…"`, `pwsh -Command "…"` — is
  re-parsed and matched, so the stated replacement still holds.

This is **not** a security boundary. If an LLM is told to work around a rule it
can rewrite the tool, recompile it under another name, symlink it, etc. — see
the README "Scope" section. For hard limits, run the agent in a sandbox.
